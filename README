### ParselOcelot

This is a fork of the What.CD tracker Ocelot to rewrite it to use a proper Tracker <-> Frontend communications API. This is an example implementation of the appropriate use of the API, which this project intends to publish as an open standard.

See https://github.com/ParselTrack/Specifications for the latest version of the API spec.
